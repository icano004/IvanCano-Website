        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a business major at the University of California - Riverside. I play for the UCR Men's Soccer Team. As a student-athlete I am forced to follow a strict daily schedule in order to do well in my classes, and to compete on the field.
        I have to be responsible and disciplined to complete my assignments, and to study for my exams. UCR offers many resources to help students in their classes, and I make sure I take advantage of my resources to help me succeed. I am on pace to graduate in 4 years. I am ahead in units, and my 3.41 GPA 
        will allow me to join the Business program by the end of the school year.<br><br>

         I have some work and volunteer experience. I helped new students move-in to apartments with my team. We moved in furniture for students, and we answered any questions they had about any classes or about the campus. We used this as an opportunity to help promote our games, and to have our team build relationships with students.
         I also volunteered at the 14th Annual Saltue to Veterans Parade in Riverside, CA. I just helped set up chairs, set up tables, and distributed water bottles to the people that were in the parade. At the end of the parade, I helped clean up. Although, I did not find any future opportunities, I did gain knowledge from veterans that 
         will help me through tough times.<br><br>

        I do not have any professional experience, but I have taken steps in order to gain professional knowledge in the future. I have volunteered in events that allowed me to meet new people that work in business. For example, I volunteered at a soccer camp that is for children whose parents aren't fortunate enough 
        to pay for the expenses to sign up their children to a team. The event was organized by the Riverside Police Department. In the event I spoke to many Police Officers, and I was lucky enough to encounter a Police Officer that was working in the field of business. He gave me his contact information, and offered to
        guide me, and he even offered me an opportunity to intern for him in the future.
